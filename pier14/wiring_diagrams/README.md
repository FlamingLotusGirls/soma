- Hints

A few notes about these diagrams.

The lower dodeca hasn't hard to understand, because L20 and L19 are toward the top, and go out to the 
axon.

The upper dodeca is harder to understand. There appear to be no markings on the sculpture
that match to these diagrams.

First, the outside is the TOP pentagon. And it's looking DOWN from the top, so clockwise
on the diagram is clockwise when looking from the top.

Second, the data distribution provides a clue as to the orientiation. There are 4 lines which
come from the axon. The data distribution box is right in the middle of the axon, so U17 is
one side along the top, and U16 is the other one.

- Wiring generally

On the axon, everything is done with 4-wire cables with connectors, which were originally purchased
from Adafruit, and we still have the part number.

In the dodecas, there are no connectors like that.

Instead, there are two-pair data wires, and two-pair electrical wires. The electrial wires are connected
at vertices using wire nuts. The data wires are connected using waterproof posi locks. For the electrical
wires, they can split (because power), but the data wires never split except at splitter boxes. The connectors
in the vertexes are all straight (1 to 1).

For the vertices with dendrites, a 4-conductor wire goes up the dendrite. Another 4-wire comes down
the dendrite, but the power lines aren't connected.

Within the dendrite, the 4-wire conductor goes up to a splitter board. The splitter board is located
at the first junction of the dendrite, and is accessed by pulling off the dendrite (remove the screw).
Two outputs go up to the two other dendrite parts, one goes up the dendrite where the splitter is, and one
comes back down to run the signal to the next location.

- Other hints

The covers for the vertices are "Penta Plus" bits. They are used in Light Poles. It's probably a P31.
